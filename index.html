    <h1>Basic JavaScript</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is the World's most popular programming language.</p>
    <p>It is the programming language of the Web.</p>
    <p>It is easy to learn.</p>
    <p>It is often abbreviated as JS.</p>
    <p>About 98% of the websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behaviour.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why study JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>HTML</u>: to define the structure of web pages.</li>
        <li><u>CSS</u>: to specify the layout or design of web pages.</li>
        <li><u>JavaScript</u>: to adding functionality to web pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>How JavaScript Works?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.</p>
    <p>It is a high level, often just-in-time compiled language.</p>
    <p>Everything in JavaScript happens inside an execution context.</p>
    <p>Whenever JavaScript code runs, a execution context will be created.</p>
    <p>It has only one call stack.</p>
    <p>JavaScript only run on JavaScript Engines.</p>
    <p>JavaScript codes were only run inside web browsers, but now it will run outside the browsers.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Versions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ECMAScript 1 - ES1</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 2 - ES2</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 3 - ES3</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 4 - ES4</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 5 - ES5</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 2015 - ES6</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 2016 - ES</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 2017 - ES</li>
        <li>ECMAScript 2018 - ES</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The original JavaScript is ES1, ES2 ans ES3. The first main revision is ES5 and the second revision is ES6. After
        that, yearly additions are 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How JavaScript Execute?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a synchronous (Moves to the next line only when the execution of the current line is completed) and
        single-threaded (Executes one command at a time in a specific order one after another serially) language. To
        know behind the scene of how JavaScript code gets executed internally, we have to know something called
        Execution Context and its role in the execution of JavaScript code.</p>
    <h4>Execution Context: </h4>
    <p>Everything in JavaScript is wrapped inside Execution Context, which is an abstract concept (can be treated as a
        container) that holds the whole information about the environment within which the current JavaScript code is
        being executed.</p>
    <p>Now, an Execution Context has two components and JavaScript code gets executed in two phases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Memory Allocation Phase</u>: In this phase, all the functions and variables of the JavaScript code get
            stored as
            a key-value pair inside the memory component of the execution context. In the case of a function, JavaScript
            copied the whole function into the memory block but in the case of variables, it assigns undefined as a
            placeholder.</li>
        <li><u>Code Execution Phase</u>: In this phase, the JavaScript code is executed one line at a time inside the
            Code
            Component (also known as the Thread of execution) of Execution Context. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Call Stack: </h4>
    <p>When a program starts execution JavaScript pushes the whole program as global context into a stack which is known
        as Call Stack and continues execution. Whenever JavaScript executes a new context and just follows the same
        process and pushes to the stack. When the context finishes, JavaScript just pops the top of the stack
        accordingly.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>We mainly use JavaScript to create:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites</li>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Server-side applications using Node.js</li>
    </ul>
    <p>but JavaScript is not limited to these things, and it can also be used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create mobile applications using tools like React Native.</li>
        <li>Create programs for microcontrollers and the internet of things.</li>
        <li>Create smartwatch applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>JavaScript does not consider white space meaningful.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
    <p>We define as literal a value that is written in the source code.</p>
    <p>JavaScript identifiers can contains a letter, the dollar sign $, an underscore _, and digits.
    </p>
    <p>Comments in JavaScript uses //.</p>
    <p>Terminatory operator (semi-colons) is optional in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>It is not Type sensitive language.</p>
    <p>Primitives types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Symbols, BigInt, Objects, Null and Undefinded.</p>
